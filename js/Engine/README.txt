Hi! It's me again, Remy. Just dropping by to say all the code in the Engine folder was made with the intention for it to be easy to use using only the methods provided in any given class.
As such, ideally you should only look through them to know about what functions are available for you to use, as there is no documentation per se.

I would gently request that:

- If you find a bug and don't know the fix, the easiest option is to ask me about it. I already know my way around all the code!
- If you find a bug and DO know the fix, you're welcome to change any file, but please give me a heads up for anything that affects the code structure, or that isn't minuscule like a typo etc.
- If you conclude that a functionality is missing, I would love for you to either add it yourself or tell me about it. This engine is still very... lightweight! :D

Lastly, I want to reiterate this point: if you want to know about any piece of this engine; what coding principles are behind it, how they're implemented etc., I would love to take some time with you to explain it in detail,
ideally in video chat. Many of the coding patterns seen here are a bare-bones version of what you would find in any large engine, notably Unity which the club uses. 
(Side note: I'm also always looking for opprtunities to video chat with any Gamkedo member, to discuss game development or anything else).

Alright, thanks for reading! Catch you guys later! :)

Remy
