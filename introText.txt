It was the year 20XX. After staying completely invisible for centuries, the first alien race was encountered. Humanity stood helpless in front of their otherworldy weaponry.
The visitors took a strong liking to Earth's fauna, its creatures unknown to their researchers. They became particularly attached to the most valuable of animals; young domesticated felines, colloquially reffered to as "kittens".

A deal was made. The aliens would leave Earth forever in exchange for 2/3rds of its kitten population.
All major forces of the world agreed that this was the best solution. But YOU, did not.

After 8 years of hard work, you have accomplished the impossible: enhancing your body with robotic parts, mastering ninja techniques, all while studying the arcane art. A supersoldier, the first and only Arcaninjadroid. Your mission is simple, rescue as many kittens as you can from the aliens, and save your own kitten Caterine from the clutches of the alien leader.
But be careful: the aliens have created new intelligent weapons inspired by Earth's creatures.

Your first objective: steal a ship from the human military base, and leave on your rogue mission to the alien planet.
